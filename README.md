  <h1>Uniform Props Plugin</h1>
 Â <p>Add extra props to all elements, which created by `React.createElement`.  </p>
</div>

<h2 align="center">Introduction</h2>

`uniform-props-webpack-plugin` is a webpack plugin, which allows you to inject one property to all react elements. You can inject only one property at present, I'll consider whether I should make it support multi properties or maybe not. This plugin is not as good as what I need, because the injected property will apply to all react elements, some of the elements maybe not support the property, so you'd better treat `uniform-props-webpack-plugin` as an temporary alternative;

<h2 align="center">Install</h2>

Install with npm: 

```bash
npm install --save-dev uniform-props-webpack-plugin
```

<h2 align="center">Usage</h2>

```js
module.exports = {
  entry: "./index.js",
  output: {
    filename: '[name].js',
  },
  plugins: [
    new UniformPropsPlugin({ size: 'small' })
  ]
}
```
